Welcome to Cornucopedia! 

Here the user will find a simple web-based app to create recipes based on the products that are already in your kitchen. Simply input your ingredients and let Cornucopedia do the work- discover new recipes and nutritional information with one click.

No special installation required. Cornucopedia will run in any web browser. To use, navigate to the website and enter your ingredient list. Cornucopedia will find recipes for you. If you see one you like, save it to the cookbook to use later and continue searching.
